[P4: Ecosystem]      ████████████████░░░░  80% (gRPC client retry policy and load balancing done)
```

### 1) Transport Layer

* **Native protocols ready**: HTTP/1.1 through HTTP/3 (QUIC via `lsquic`), WebSocket, SSE, and a bounded GraphQL query layer are implemented in-tree (WebTransport server/client evaluation is isolated to `dev`). Low-level socket controls (ECN, 0-RTT, connection migration) are complete.
* **HTTP/3 browser hardening**: Response header emission now normalizes field names to lowercase and rejects CR/LF-bearing values, covering login/logout cookie and redirect paths in strict browsers such as Firefox.
* **HTTPS hot-path optimization**: HTTP/1.1 connections now remain alive across requests, TLS writes stream headers and bodies separately without an intermediate response blob, and prefork workers share session-ticket keys for cross-worker resumption.
* **Request-memory optimization**: Parsed request strings and static response headers use arena-backed or borrowed storage with copy-on-write detachment, while received bodies can transfer ownership without a second copy.
* **Async I/O optimization (`io_uring`)**: io_uring serves as the readiness/wait layer inside `reactor.c` (epoll_wait replacement); its ring setup, teardown, and free-stack slot infrastructure were absorbed from the retired completion-based backend.
* **Multiport HTTP/3 fan-out**: The `cwist_multiport_t` facade now creates per-port UDP contexts and copies global HTTP/3 settings unless a port is detached into a sub-app.

### 2) Application Layer

* **High-performance router & middleware**: Deterministic resource management with parameterized routes (`/user/:id`), compression (Gzip via zlib), CORS, and rate limiting (libttak token bucket) are integrated.
* **Observability**: Prometheus `/metrics` and a probe-registry health-check system are operational.
* **Per-port sub-applications**: Lifecycle and exception handling for `cwist_multiport_get_app(&app, port)` are hardened; detached ports are separately tunable sub-applications. "Independently tunable" covers app-level config (routes, middleware, TLS, size limits) -- it does not extend to process-wide subsystems. `cwist_full_gc()` (see docs/GC.md) is one process-wide switch: enabling it for one sub-app enables it for every `cwist_app` instance sharing that process, with no per-app opt-out. The cJSON allocator hook installed at process start is the same shape. A deployment that needs different memory-management behavior per sub-app needs separate processes, not separate `cwist_app` instances in one process.
* **gRPC services**: Applications can register unary and streaming handlers, incrementally decode arbitrarily split gRPC frames, attach transport output sinks, expose standard health/reflection services, and generate C models/method paths with `cwist proto`. Clients use `cwist_grpc_channel`: dns/ipv4/ipv6 target resolution, `pick_first`/`round_robin` load balancing over per-address subchannels, and the gRFC A6 retry engine (exponential backoff, retryable codes, server pushback, throttling, transparent retries); error responses go out Trailers-Only so conforming clients can retry.
* **Packaging**: `libcwist.a` is a CWIST-only static archive; bundled dependency archives and public headers install side-by-side with `PREFIX`/`DESTDIR` staging support. `cwist.pc` pkg-config metadata, a versioned dist tarball (`dist/cwist-3.2.tar.gz`), and Homebrew (`packaging/homebrew/cwist.rb`) / vcpkg (`packaging/vcpkg/`) packaging drafts are available.
* **Deferred async handlers**: `cwist_async_defer()` hands a request/response pair to any thread (scheduler job, NATS callback, custom worker) for later completion via `cwist_async_respond()` / `respond_with()` / `abort()`, with optional 504 timeout and per-mode completion routing (reactor-posted in C1M, inline in thread-pool mode).

### 3) Security & Data Layer

* **Security specs**: BoringSSL-based TLS 1.3 and hybrid post-quantum KEM (`X25519MLKEM768`) are implemented ahead of time. CSRF uses a 256-bit double-submit token with constant-time validation; WAF-lite compiles its signature set into an Aho-Corasick automaton (single O(n) pass per input, ~10.7M checks/s benchmarked) plus HTML output escaping.
* **Data-layer integrity**: SQLite3 embedded integration, migration system, and a `_Generic` macro-based type-dispatched ORM/query builder are in the build stream. The lock-free work queue (`cwist_io_queue`) protects node reclamation with ttak EBR critical sections and a two-stage retire deferral across global-epoch boundaries, and scheduler-backed background jobs are implemented.
* **Protobuf wire helpers**: A lightweight Protobuf runtime supports varint keys, unsigned/signed/bool fields, length-delimited bytes/strings, reader iteration, and ZigZag helpers for hand-written services.

## Current Snapshot

<!-- CI-BENCHMARKS:START -->
Automated OS benchmark history is published in `docs/benchmark-trends.svg`. Latest platform: **Darwin**.
<!-- CI-BENCHMARKS:END -->

- Core HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSocket, routing, middleware, validation, metrics, health checks, static-file caching, and graceful shutdown are fully implemented in-tree.
- **Developer Ecosystem & Tutorials**: 30 comprehensive hands-on tutorial modules with C source (`main.c`), `CMakeLists.txt`, and English documentation guides (`README.md`) are available under `tutorials/`.
- **CI Automated Web Server Benchmark**: Inline CI job dynamically generates and measures CWIST, Axum, and Spring Boot web servers using `wrk`, rendering real-time RPS, Latency, Peak RSS, and Context Switch metrics. A `the-benchmarker/web-frameworks` contract app lives in `benchmarks/web-frameworks/`, pinned to the `v3.3` tag with the uriparser lib path wired in.
- **P0 (must-have) is 100% complete**: the framework’s core architecture and protocol stack are locked.
- **Resolved**: HTTP/3 header-set objects for streams still open at engine destroy are now tracked per `cwist_http3_context` and swept on the engine/context teardown path; the `leak:cwist_h3_hsi_create` entry was removed from `tests/lsan.supp`.
- **Resolved**: Deferred async completions on the reactor path now park unsent bytes in an owned buffer and resume via one-shot POLLOUT (`cwist_reactor_add_out`), so slow clients no longer occupy a worker/reactor thread for the send budget; a deadline (keep-alive timeout, refreshed on progress) bounds parked writers.
- **Resolved**: gRPC handler-thread sends now wait for WINDOW_UPDATE credit via a condvar rendezvous signalled by the dispatcher (`h2_fc_wait_credit`), instead of failing a zero-credit send with UNAVAILABLE; RST/teardown/stall-timeout still fail fast.
- **Resolved (v3.4 perf wave)**: C1M reactor tail latency — request batches now yield cooperatively (`CWIST_HTTP_YIELD_BATCH`), batch responses coalesce into one writev per turn (256 KiB stash), reactor wake eventfds are registered with the ring (`IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD`), and post bursts coalesce to a single wake. P99.999 CI measurement fixed end-to-end (lua output format + `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` script path).
- **Resolved (v3.4 perf wave)**: BDR cache learn/read paths are lock-free (CAS-published entries, atomic blob swaps, EBR reclamation) and entries support hit-time revalidation hooks with zero-copy pointer swaps (`cwist_bdr_put_revalidatable`); classic pool gained `CWIST_POOL_PREWARM` / `CWIST_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` tunables; the HTTPS handshake shepherd shard count is tunable via `CWIST_HTTPS_HS_SHARDS`.
- **Resolved (v3.4 gRPC client wave)**: gRPC client retry policy and client-side load balancing are done — `cwist_grpc_channel` resolves dns/ipv4/ipv6 targets into per-address subchannels with connection backoff (doc/connection-backoff.md), balances calls with `pick_first`/`round_robin` (doc/load-balancing.md), and runs the gRFC A6 retry engine (jittered exponential backoff, retryable codes, server pushback, token-bucket throttling, transparent retries, commit-on-headers) configured via C structs or JSON service config. Error responses are Trailers-Only on both unary and streaming server paths so retries can actually happen; `test_grpc_channel` covers the matrix against loopback backends plus a raw GOAWAY fake.
- We are now in the **P2–P4 tooling and ecosystem phase**. Completed multiport, scheduler, test-client, `io_uring`, deferred async handlers, end-to-end streaming gRPC (DATA-frame wiring, trailers, deadlines, gzip), and Protobuf wire-format work remain covered by focused regression tests.

## Current Focus (P2 – P4 Tooling and Ecosystem)

The completed P1-P3 hardening work is now under regression coverage. Current priorities are developer workflow and ecosystem integrations.

### Developer Workflow

* Expand benchmark automation (the-benchmarker contract app) and fuzz targets.
* Keep test-client, scheduler, multiport, `io_uring`, and deferred-async coverage in the default test harness.

### Ecosystem

* Finish `cwist proto` for v3.4: ~~descriptor-set input~~ (`oneof`, `map`, fixed-width types, `double`, and `protoc --descriptor_set_out` input all done alongside scalar/enum/nested/repeated-packed).
* ~~Add gRPC client-side support: h2/h2c client, retry policy, and load balancing.~~ (h2c/TLS client with unary + server-streaming calls, deadlines, and cancellation; channel with `pick_first`/`round_robin` LB over per-address subchannels; gRFC A6 retry policy with backoff, pushback, throttling, and transparent retries — all shipped)
* Add gRPC server-side response compression.
* Extend the GraphQL subset with schema validation, mutations, nested selections, and subscriptions.
* Stabilize the experimental native C WebTransport client after LSQUIC PR #629 merges upstream.
* Evaluate persistent job backends separately from the in-process queue/scheduler.

### gRPC / Protobuf Status

Completed:

* `cwist_app_grpc_unary(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers `POST /Service/Method` routes for HTTP/2 gRPC unary calls.
* `cwist_app_grpc_stream(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers buffered streaming handlers that can consume multiple request messages and append multiple response messages in order.
* `cwist_grpc_decode_message()` and `cwist_grpc_encode_message()` implement the gRPC 5-byte message envelope (`compressed` flag + big-endian payload length).
* `cwist_grpc_decode_next_message()` iterates concatenated gRPC message envelopes for client-streaming and bidi-style buffered request bodies.
* `cwist_grpc_stream_send()` and `cwist_grpc_stream_close()` build ordered multi-message gRPC responses with final status metadata.
* `cwist_grpc_decoder_feed()` recovers gRPC envelopes split across arbitrary DATA payload boundaries; `cwist_grpc_stream_set_writer()` permits immediate transport-frame output.
* `cwist_app_grpc_health()` and `cwist_app_grpc_health_set_status()` register and control `grpc.health.v1.Health`; `cwist_app_grpc_reflection()` registers the v1alpha reflection stream.
* `cwist proto input.proto` (or a `protoc --descriptor_set_out` binary, auto-detected or via `--descriptor-set`) generates scalar proto3 C models, encoder helpers, and gRPC method-path constants.
* `cwist_grpc_set_response()` and `cwist_grpc_set_error()` produce `application/grpc` responses and explicit `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` metadata.
* `cwist_pb_writer` supports varint keys, uint64/int64/bool fields, bytes fields, string fields, and dynamic buffer growth.
* `cwist_pb_reader` iterates Protobuf fields and exposes wire type, field number, varint value, and length-delimited payload slices.
* `cwist_pb_zigzag_encode()` / `cwist_pb_zigzag_decode()` cover signed integer mappings used by `sint32` / `sint64` style fields.
* `test_grpc` verifies Protobuf request construction, gRPC frame handling, unary dispatch, buffered streaming dispatch, multi-message response parsing, invalid content type handling, and malformed frame rejection.

* HTTP/2 streaming calls are wired end-to-end: inbound DATA frames feed `cwist_grpc_decoder_feed()` directly (client-streaming handlers see messages as they arrive via the blocking `cwist_grpc_stream_recv()`), and `cwist_grpc_stream_send()` flushes DATA frames immediately from the handler thread. The app server wires this via `cwist_http2_serve_connection_ex()` + `cwist_grpc_http2_hooks()`.
* `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` are emitted in a dedicated HTTP/2 trailer HEADERS frame (END_STREAM) for both unary and streaming responses.
* `grpc-timeout` is parsed (`cwist_grpc_parse_timeout()`), enforced on streaming calls (DEADLINE_EXCEEDED trailers plus handler cancellation), and client RST_STREAM propagates to handlers via `cwist_grpc_stream_cancelled()` / a `-1` recv.
* Request metadata is normalized: header names are lowercased at the HTTP/2 layer, lookups are case-insensitive (`cwist_grpc_metadata_get()`), and `*-bin` values are base64-decoded (`cwist_grpc_metadata_get_binary()`).
* Compression negotiation: `grpc-encoding: gzip` request messages are inflated (zlib), `grpc-accept-encoding: gzip, identity` is advertised, response messages are compressed with gzip when client advertises `grpc-accept-encoding: gzip` (with `grpc-encoding: gzip` header and frame compressed flag set), and unsupported encodings are rejected with `UNIMPLEMENTED`.
* `test_grpc` covers the buffered path (unary/streaming dispatch, metadata, gzip request decompression & response compression, recv replay, timeout parsing); `test_grpc_stream` covers the wire path over h2c (split DATA delivery, trailer frames, deadline, RST cancellation, gzip request/response compression, unsupported-encoding rejection).

Known limits:

* The proto generator covers scalar, enum, repeated packed-numeric, `oneof`, `map`, and fixed-width/`double` proto3 fields plus service paths, with descriptor-set input (nested types flatten on that path); text input still lacks nested message definitions.
* The builtin health `Watch` route streams status changes over the HTTP/2 transport path and falls back to a single snapshot on the buffered dispatch path.
* Client-side hedging (`hedgingPolicy`) is not implemented — gRPC C-core does not implement it either (gRFC A6). The channel resolver supports `dns` (default), `ipv4`, and `ipv6` targets; `unix`/`unix-abstract`/`vsock` transports, `grpclb`/xDS policies, and `perAttemptRecvTimeout` remain unimplemented.

### gRPC Client Channel (v3.4)

Completed:

* `cwist_grpc_channel_connect(target, options)` resolves `dns:[//authority/]host[:port]` (default scheme, default port 443, every resolved address used), `ipv4:`/`ipv6:` literal lists, and bare `host[:port]` targets (doc/naming.md); unsupported schemes fail cleanly.
* One lazily-connected subchannel per backend address; failed dials back off per doc/connection-backoff.md (1s initial, ×1.6, 120s cap, ±0.2 jitter, reset when the SETTINGS handshake completes).
* `pick_first` (default) sticks to the connected address and fails over in resolver order; `round_robin` dials every address up front and rotates READY subchannels per call (doc/load-balancing.md). `cwist_grpc_channel_get_state()` aggregates subchannel states per the spec rules.
* gRFC A6 retry engine between the channel and the LB pick: `maxAttempts` (client-capped at 5), `initialBackoff`/`maxBackoff`/`backoffMultiplier` with ±0.2 jitter, `retryableStatusCodes` bitmask, overall call deadline shared by all attempts, per-attempt remaining `grpc-timeout`, and the `grpc-previous-rpc-attempts` header on every retry.
* Commit semantics: Response-Headers commit the RPC (no further retries); Trailers-Only failures stay retryable. Transparent retries cover RPCs that never left the client (until the deadline) and RPCs refused before server application logic (RST_STREAM REFUSED_STREAM or GOAWAY with a lower last-stream-id, one immediate retry) — neither counts against `maxAttempts` nor the throttle.
* Server pushback: `grpc-retry-pushback-ms` ≥ 0 delays the retry exactly that long (backoff restarts at `initialBackoff` afterwards); negative or unparseable values stop retries.
* `retryThrottling` token bucket per channel: retries need `token_count > maxTokens/2`; failed attempts with retryable codes (or do-not-retry pushback) cost one token, successful calls refund `tokenRatio`.
* `cwist_grpc_channel_apply_service_config_json()` parses the doc/service_config.md subset — `loadBalancingConfig`/`loadBalancingPolicy`, `methodConfig` (name matching, `retryPolicy`, `waitForReady`, `timeout`), and `retryThrottling` — with gRFC A6 validation rules.
* Error responses are Trailers-Only end-to-end (gRFC A6 / PROTOCOL-HTTP2): unary error replies are a single HEADERS frame with END_STREAM, and the streaming server delays Response-Headers until the first message, so conforming clients can retry failed calls. Servers can emit `grpc-retry-pushback-ms` via a response header (unary) or `cwist_grpc_stream_set_retry_pushback()` (streaming).
* `test_grpc_channel` covers LB stickiness/failover/rotation, retryable/non-retryable codes, `maxAttempts` exhaustion, pushback both ways, throttling, deadlines spanning attempts, JSON service config validation, GOAWAY transparent retries against a raw-socket fake, and resolver schemes; `test_grpc_stream` verifies the Trailers-Only wire forms.

## v3.4 Milestone (Released 2026-09-12, hotfix v3.4.1 on 2026-09-14)

Theme: gRPC client side, codegen completeness, and the first WASM client-side support wave. v3.3 shipped the wire-level streaming server (DATA-frame wiring, trailers, deadlines, gzip) plus the first proto codegen extension (enums, nested message fields, repeated packed numerics); v3.4 finishes the story instead of moving the already-pushed v3.3 tag.

* **`cwist proto` completion**: ~~`oneof`, `map`, fixed-width types (`fixed32/64`, `sfixed32/64`, `double`), and `protoc --descriptor_set_out` input bindings~~ (all done). CLI-only work (`tools/cli/cwist`), no library ABI impact.
* **gRPC client**: ~~h2/h2c client with unary/streaming calls, retry policy, and client-side load balancing~~ (all done: `cwist_grpc_client_*` with deadlines and cancellation, plus `cwist_grpc_channel_*` with resolver, `pick_first`/`round_robin` LB, and the gRFC A6 retry engine).
* **gRPC server leftovers**: ~~moving health `Watch` onto the streaming dispatch path~~ (done).
* **Distribution**: ~~publish the Homebrew formula~~ (done: `brew tap c4punks/cwist`, `brew install c4punks/cwist/cwist`, verified end-to-end on Linuxbrew). vcpkg stays an in-tree draft under `packaging/vcpkg/`; upstream submission postponed.
* **WASM client-side support**: bring CWIST handlers into the browser WASM ecosystem.
  * ~~In-memory HTTP dispatcher~~ ✅ (`cwist_app_dispatch_memory()`): run `cwist_app` routing and handlers directly on request/response memory buffers, with no sockets — so the same C handlers run inside a Service Worker or a JS fetch-interception layer.
  * ~~`libcwist_wasm.a` target~~ ✅ (`make wasm`): an Emscripten build that excludes the native transport (sockets, TLS, QUIC) and ships the socket-independent core — app dispatch, mux/middleware, HTTP/1 parser/serializer, query map, cJSON, memory utilities.
  * ~~`cwist_db` in-memory/blob abstraction~~ ✅ (`cwist_db_open_memory()` / `cwist_db_serialize()`): official API over `sqlite3_deserialize`-style memory buffers, so WASM apps don't need to parse custom binary blobs.
  * ~~TypedArray zero-copy serialization helpers~~ ✅ (`<cwist/wasm/typedarray.h>`): Emscripten-side macros/headers that map C struct arrays directly onto `HEAP` TypedArrays instead of round-tripping through `snprintf` JSON.

## v3.5 Milestone (Released 2026-09-15)

Theme: **Full GC — automatic resource reclamation**. Today CWIST relies on explicit destroy-family calls (`cwist_app_destroy`, connection/session teardown, `cwist_free`) paired with arena discipline. v3.5 makes cleanup automatic where it matters: threads and processes ending must close connections, and `cwist_alloc` objects must evaporate without manual frees. Design document: `docs/GC.md`.

* **`cwist_full_gc(bool)` global toggle**: ~~when enabled, connections are closed automatically on worker-thread exit and process exit even without explicit destroy calls; when disabled (default), the current explicit model runs unchanged at zero cost~~ (done — `src/core/mem/gc.c`, see Tutorial 30).
* **Connection reclamation via libttak epoch GC** (`ttak_epoch_gc`, already wrapped by `src/core/mem/gc.c`): ~~per-thread connection registration with epoch-deferred teardown, so a connection swept at thread exit can never UAF a thread still referencing it~~ (done — `test_conn_registry`, `test_gc_ebr_release`, `test_full_gc_sweep`).
* **`cwist_alloc` registration**: ~~allocations route into the full-GC context (internal changes to `src/core/mem/alloc.c`) so objects are reclaimed by epoch rotation instead of manual `cwist_free` calls~~ (done — gated on `cwist_full_gc_enabled()`, registered via `cwist_reg_ptr_sized`).
* **Pseudo-RAII**: ~~scoped guards via GCC/Clang `__attribute__((cleanup))` for handle-like locals, plus raw borrowing of LibTTAK RAII primitives~~ (done — `CWIST_DEFER_FREE`/`CWIST_SCRATCH_DEFER` in `include/cwist/core/mem/alloc.h`, used in tutorials 07/28).
* **Transparent `malloc` interception**: ~~users will habitually write `malloc`, not `cwist_alloc` — so handler-thread `malloc` calls should evaporate the same way `cwist_alloc()` calls do~~ (done — `include/cwist/core/mem/intercept.h`, opt-in per translation unit via `#define CWIST_INTERCEPT_MALLOC` before including it). Header-scoped `#define malloc cwist_malloc_shim` (never `-Wl,--wrap=malloc` — link-level wrapping was considered and rejected, since it would also intercept vendored dependencies like BoringSSL/lsquic that never include CWIST headers and have no reason to expect a non-libc allocator underneath them, e.g. BoringSSL's `OPENSSL_cleanse()`-then-free assumes plain heap semantics). Covers `calloc`/`realloc`/`free` consistently from the same seam (`src/core/mem/alloc.c`); reclaim cadence reuses the existing `cwist_gc_scope_track`/`cwist_gc_scope_flush` pipeline unchanged; cross-thread handoff reuses the existing `cwist_gc_scope_disown()` escape hatch. Measured overhead (`tests/bench_malloc_intercept.c`): ~+3% when full-GC is off (default), ~+86% when on (the real cost of the tracking safety net) — see `docs/GC.md` section 5 for the full table and methodology.
* **Thread/process exit sweeps**: ~~thread-local connection registry with pthread TLS destructors for worker exit, and an `atexit` sweep for process exit~~ (done — `test_io_queue_full_gc`, `test_full_gc_ownership_handoff`).
* **Evaluate a `mimalloc` backend for `cwist_alloc`/the epoch-GC heap** (tracked in #25): ~~evaluate via `LD_PRELOAD` A/B against jemalloc and tcmalloc, then vendor mimalloc if the data holds up~~ (done, result: **negative** — real CI A/B (PR #34) showed mimalloc regressing every metric on CWIST's prefork C1M model: RPS −1.8%, P99.999 +97%, RSS +120%, root-caused to mimalloc's eager per-process arena reservation being a poor fit for many short-lived low-allocation forked processes. `mallopt(M_ARENA_MAX, 1)` (`CWIST_MALLOC_ARENA_MAX`, PR #35, merged) targets the same "N processes × M arenas" mechanism without mimalloc's reservation cost and won on every metric instead — see issue #25 for the full writeup. Note: the P99.999-vs-Axum gap that originally motivated this item was measured via the-benchmarker's public `percentile99999` field, which turned out to be mislabeled P99.99, not true P99.999 (found during PR #48's validation, also on #25) — the qualitative direction (Axum ahead on tail latency) likely still holds, but the "2.8–3.6x" figure specifically should not be cited as P99.999 going forward).
* **Full-GC malloc interception overhead** (tracked in #65): the ~+86% full-GC-on overhead measured above is real but unprofiled; reducing it is follow-up work, not a v3.5 blocker.

## v3.6 Milestone (Released 2026-09-21)

Theme: **WASM client-side support**. v3.4 shipped the gRPC client wave; v3.5 shipped full GC; v3.6 takes the WASM client-side support wave from "in-tree target" to "usable from JavaScript". Tracked in issue #93.

* **Phase 1: in-tree WASM correctness** (issue #93 gaps 1-4, PR #176) — ~~done~~ (merged 2026-09-17):
  * ~~`cwist_db` in the WASM build (`src/core/db/db.c` + `lib/sqlite3/sqlite3.c` in `WASM_SRCS`), so `cwist_db_open_memory()` / `cwist_db_serialize()` work under Emscripten as the roadmap has long claimed~~ (done).
  * ~~Fix the EM_JS corruption from the tree-wide clang-format pass (`=>` rewritten to `= >` inside brace-block JS bodies); `clang-format off/on` guards plus `make format-check` coverage so it cannot recur~~ (done).
  * ~~Emscripten build + smoke test as a CI gate (`.github/workflows/wasm.yml`)~~ (done; scoped to the wasm files after runner clang-format version skew produced false tree-wide failures).
  * ~~`docs/api/wasm.md`: build, scope, the `dispatch_memory` pattern, TypedArray helpers, the db round trip, session caveats~~ (done).
* **Phase 2: JavaScript consumption** (issues #183/#184, PR #185) — ~~done~~ (merged 2026-09-18; both issues auto-closed):
  * ~~npm/release packaging for `libcwist_wasm.a` and the smoke-tested artifact~~ (done — `wasm/npm/` publishes the `cwist-wasm` package: `index.js` fetch-style API, `index.d.ts`, README; `make wasm-dist` builds the tarball, CI verifies a clean install).
  * ~~First-party JS wrapper exposing the `dispatch_memory` request path and TypedArray views without requiring consumers to write Emscripten glue~~ (done — `include/cwist/wasm/wasm_entry.h` `CWIST_WASM_DEFINE_ENTRY`, plus the `_main` export pitfall documented: without it the linker dead-code-eliminates `main`).
* **Phase 3: streaming + session model** (done on `feat/wasm-phase3`):
  * ~~WASI target evaluation~~ (done — the blockers recorded in
    `docs/api/wasi.md` turned out to be CWIST-side quirks, so both WASI
    flavours landed in-tree instead of staying a separate workstream:
    preview1 (`wasm32-wasi`) runs the in-memory dispatch surface under
    wasmtime, and WASI 0.2 (`wasm32-wasip2`) binds real sockets and serves
    cleartext HTTP through `wasi:sockets`; experimental, see
    `docs/api/wasi.md`).
  * ~~Streaming request/response bodies through the WASM boundary~~ (done:
    `cwist_app_dispatch_stream` + `cwist_stream_req_begin/feed/end` in
    app.h/app.c; boundary streaming, not a chunked-producer handler API.
    The `CWIST_WASM_DEFINE_ENTRY` macro exports
    `_cwist_wasm_dispatch_stream`, pumping chunks through a
    `Module.cwistStreamChunk` JS hook).
  * ~~Session persistence model for WASM apps~~ (done and measured: the
    model is "pin the signing secret, let the signed client-side cookie
    carry the state" - instance lifetime is irrelevant. The WASM build now
    actually links sessions via a bundled header-only SHA-256/HMAC
    (`include/cwist/core/crypto/sha256.h`; OpenSSL is not in WASM_SRCS, so
    pre-Phase-3 session.o could never link), with a
    `crypto.getRandomValues` entropy fallback when /dev/urandom is absent.
    Verified across app instances in `tests/test_wasm_stream.c` and the
    Emscripten smoke test; documented in `docs/api/wasm.md`).
* **Phase 4: reach** (issue #93, PR #198) — ~~done~~ (merged 2026-09-21):
  * ~~End-to-end example app (Service Worker or fetch-interception layer)~~ (done — `example/wasm-service-worker/`: a full CWIST app (routing + zod validation + template rendering + `cwist_db` + pinned-secret sessions) served by a Service Worker fetch-interception layer with its own cookie jar; CI-gated via the WASM job's example build + node smoke).

Landeds alongside the WASM wave, also in scope for v3.6:

* **Per-event latency probe** (issue #166, PR #186, merged): `CWIST_LATENCY_PROBE=1` records arm-to-dispatch queue delay and callback runtime histograms per reactor, dumped at destroy. First measurement at the CI operating point: queue delay p99 = 10 ms while callback p50 = 25 us — the tail lives before dispatch.
* **RX-uring receive path** (issue #179, PR #187, merged): one `IORING_OP_RECV` SQE replaces the POLL_ADD + recv() pair on the C1M async path (Linux io_uring reactors only; `CWIST_RX_URING=0` restores legacy byte-identically). A per-connection learn flag keeps non-pipelining clients at the legacy op count (measured neutral: 342.4k vs 341.7k rps, t12 c400); the pipelining win case is unproven pending a pipelining workload.
* **WebSocket non-blocking I/O** (issue #181, PR #182, merged): reactor-driven WebSocket on C1M (classic mode keeps blocking I/O), callback-style API, `CWIST_WS_ASYNC_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 300 s).
* **SQPOLL evaluation** (closed, negative): kernel SQ-thread wakeup discipline on 6.12 makes producer-side SQPOLL at best equal to the polled ring and at worst a multi-ms stall source; SQ_AFF stabilizes it but never beats the plain submit-enter (issue #179 comments).

Known limits going in (from PR #176 review), updated:

* ~~Bundle size impact of pulling SQLite into `libcwist_wasm.a` is unmeasured~~ — measured and decided (2026-09-21): `libcwist_wasm.a` 328,518 -> 1,703,706 B (5.2x), but the linked-size cost is paid only by apps that reference `cwist_db_*` — a db-less app still links ~64.8 KB, the pre-db size — and for db users the ~1 MB is SQLite's reachable core (`-ffunction-sections`/`--gc-sections` recover ~0; emcc -O2 already DCEs cross-module). Decision: no opt-out/split build; the remaining lever if ever needed is `SQLITE_OMIT_*`, not packaging. Details in `docs/api/wasm.md`.
* ~~Session behavior under the WASM dispatch model is documented but not yet measured; Phase 3 needs observed behavior, not the current caveats list~~ — now measured (Phase 3: cross-instance verify/reject in `tests/test_wasm_stream.c` and the Emscripten smoke test; model documented in `docs/api/wasm.md`).

## Release Line & Codenames

* The 3.x line is stabilization work on the road to v4.0: release intervals are deliberately long, and each release lands a small number of large, well-tested changes rather than frequent small ones. Expect wide gaps between 3.x tags.
* The first 100% production-compatible stable release is planned as **v4.0**. Until then, minor releases may adjust public APIs (see the versioning note in the README).
* Starting with the stable line (v4.0 onward), each release receives a codename in the form **adjective + color** (e.g. "Steady Amber"). Codenames are assigned at release time and recorded here.

### Versioning rules (as practiced)

The tag history (`v0.1` → `v3.3`) settles into this convention from v3 onward, and it is the rule going forward:

* **Tags**: `v<major>.<minor>` for feature releases (`v3`, `v3.1`, `v3.2`, `v3.3`). Urgent fixes to a released tag get a patch level, `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (`v2.5.1`, `v2.4.1`) — patches are for hotfixes only, never for features.
* **Major** (`v2` → `v3`): a generational milestone — a broad capability jump (e.g. v3 = first reliable release, HTTP/2 stabilization). Majors are rare.
* **Minor** (`v3.2` → `v3.3`): one coherent feature theme (v3.2: HTTP/3 standards compliance + security hardening; v3.3: gRPC streaming + deferred async handlers). A minor is cut when its theme is complete, not on a calendar.
* **Release title**: `CWIST vX.Y` followed by an em-dash summary of the headline theme ("CWIST v3.3 — gRPC streaming, deferred async handlers, and stability hardening"). Pre-v3 releases used freeform subtitles ("Firefox Compatibility"); the em-dash form is the standard now.
* **Release body**: "Highlights since vX.(Y−1)" or "Major changes compared to vX.(Y−1)", grouped into numbered/sectioned items with commit references where useful.
* The 0.x line was pre-1.0 experimentation; the 1.x–2.x lines were feature accretion with themed minors. None of that constrains the 3.x rules above.
