```

### 1) Transport Layer

* **Native protocols ready**: HTTP/1.1 through HTTP/3 (QUIC via `lsquic`), WebTransport server support, WebSocket, SSE, and a bounded GraphQL query layer are implemented in-tree. Low-level socket controls (ECN, 0-RTT, connection migration) are complete.
* **HTTP/3 browser hardening**: Response header emission now normalizes field names to lowercase and rejects CR/LF-bearing values, covering login/logout cookie and redirect paths in strict browsers such as Firefox.
* **Async I/O optimization (`io_uring`)**: `io_uring_backend.c`, SQE/CQE synchronization, demolition safety, and focused tests are complete.
* **Multiport HTTP/3 fan-out**: The `cwist_multiport_t` facade now creates per-port UDP contexts and copies global HTTP/3 settings unless a port is detached into a sub-app.

### 2) Application Layer

* **High-performance router & middleware**: Deterministic resource management with parameterized routes (`/user/:id`), compression (Gzip via zlib), CORS, and rate limiting (libttak token bucket) are integrated.
* **Observability**: Prometheus `/metrics` and a probe-registry health-check system are operational.
* **Per-port sub-applications**: Lifecycle and exception handling for `cwist_multiport_get_app(&app, port)` are hardened; detached ports are separately tunable sub-applications.
* **gRPC services**: Applications can register unary and streaming handlers, incrementally decode arbitrarily split gRPC frames, attach transport output sinks, expose standard health/reflection services, and generate C models/method paths with `cwist proto`.

### 3) Security & Data Layer

* **Security specs**: BoringSSL-based TLS 1.3 and hybrid post-quantum KEM (`X25519MLKEM768`) are implemented ahead of time. CSRF uses a 256-bit double-submit token with constant-time validation; WAF-lite uses bounded linear scans and HTML output escaping.
* **Data-layer integrity**: SQLite3 embedded integration, migration system, and a `_Generic` macro-based type-dispatched ORM/query builder are in the build stream. The lock-free work queue (`cwist_io_queue`) and scheduler-backed background jobs are implemented.
* **Protobuf wire helpers**: A lightweight Protobuf runtime supports varint keys, unsigned/signed/bool fields, length-delimited bytes/strings, reader iteration, and ZigZag helpers for hand-written services.

## Current Snapshot

- Core HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSocket, routing, middleware, validation, metrics, health checks, static-file caching, and graceful shutdown are already implemented in-tree.
- **P0 (must-have) is 100 % complete**: the framework’s core architecture and protocol stack are locked.
- We are now in the **P2–P4 tooling and ecosystem phase**. Completed multiport, scheduler, test-client, `io_uring`, unary gRPC, and Protobuf wire-format work remain covered by focused regression tests.

## CWIST v3.8 Roadmap (In Progress)

v3.7 is released. WebTransport moved to v4.1 on 2026-09-25 (see the v4.1
section below), so v3.8 spends its cycle on work CWIST controls end to end:
closing the measured latency gaps, making CWIST callable from Rust, and
confirming the v4.0 scope. Discussion: https://github.com/c4punks/CWIST/discussions/268.

Entry criteria for v3.8: every item must (a) move a measured performance
number, (b) serve the Rust bindings, (c) close a correctness gap carried over
from v3.7, or (d) resolve a v4.0 blocker. New public C API is allowed only when
it is additive. Scope does not grow; anything not ready slips.

### v3.8 Status at a Glance

| Phase | Goal | Status | Next Actions |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| **1 — Performance** | Close reactor/Classic/Axum latency gaps; validate RX-uring pipelining; HTTPS handshake shards; worker warmup | Mostly done | #293 has the data; #294 raised `CWIST_HTTPS_HS_SHARDS` default floor to 4 and MAX to 16; RX-uring and worker warmup dropped |
| **2 — Rust FFI** | Make CWIST callable from Rust (`cwist-sys` + `cwist`) | Done | Middleware and deferred-async wrappers landed; `example/rust-hello/` and FFI overhead benchmark added; built-in middleware factory wrappers and owned `cwist_async_respond_with` helper done; `cwist-sys` and `cwist` v0.1.0 published to crates.io |
| **3 — HTTP/3 close correctness** | Re-pin lsquic when upstream fixes land; add CONNECTION_CLOSE interop gate | Deferred indefinitely | On hold until upstream lsquic ships WebTransport client support; no separate cutoff |
| **4 — v4.0 scope confirmation** | Enact v3.7 Phase 5 decisions and record v4.0 fate for every experimental item | Done | v3.7 Phase 5 enacted; GraphQL subscriptions, durable queue, Redis RESP2/NATS borrow promoted to supported; WASM component pipeline ships experimental at v4.0 with promotion re-evaluated at v4.1; WebTransport experimental until v4.1; docs audit done |

* Wire the incremental gRPC output sink directly to HTTP/2 DATA-frame flushing and dedicated trailers.
* Extend `cwist proto` beyond scalar proto3 models to repeated, nested, enum, and descriptor-set bindings.
* Add gRPC deadlines, cancellation propagation, metadata normalization, retry policy, and load balancing.
* Extend the GraphQL subset with schema validation, mutations, nested selections, and subscriptions.
* Add a native C WebTransport client after adopting a QUIC dependency with client-session support.
* Evaluate persistent job backends separately from the in-process queue/scheduler.

### gRPC / Protobuf Status

Completed:

* `cwist_app_grpc_unary(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers `POST /Service/Method` routes for HTTP/2 gRPC unary calls.
* `cwist_grpc_decode_message()` and `cwist_grpc_encode_message()` implement the gRPC 5-byte message envelope (`compressed` flag + big-endian payload length).
* `cwist_grpc_decode_next_message()` iterates concatenated gRPC message envelopes for client-streaming and bidi-style buffered request bodies.
* `cwist_grpc_stream_send()` and `cwist_grpc_stream_close()` build ordered multi-message gRPC responses with final status metadata.
* `cwist_grpc_decoder_feed()` recovers gRPC envelopes split across arbitrary DATA payload boundaries; `cwist_grpc_stream_set_writer()` permits immediate transport-frame output.
* `cwist_app_grpc_health()` and `cwist_app_grpc_health_set_status()` register and control `grpc.health.v1.Health`; `cwist_app_grpc_reflection()` registers the v1alpha reflection stream.
* `cwist proto input.proto` generates scalar proto3 C models, encoder helpers, and gRPC method-path constants.
* `cwist_grpc_set_response()` and `cwist_grpc_set_error()` produce `application/grpc` responses and explicit `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` metadata.
* `cwist_pb_writer` supports varint keys, uint64/int64/bool fields, bytes fields, string fields, and dynamic buffer growth.
* `cwist_pb_reader` iterates Protobuf fields and exposes wire type, field number, varint value, and length-delimited payload slices.
* `cwist_pb_zigzag_encode()` / `cwist_pb_zigzag_decode()` cover signed integer mappings used by `sint32` / `sint64` style fields.
* `test_grpc` verifies Protobuf request construction, gRPC frame handling, unary dispatch, Protobuf response parsing, invalid content type handling, and malformed frame rejection.

Known limits:

* The incremental decoder and output sink are available now; the current HTTP/2 dispatcher still buffers inbound bodies and needs direct DATA-frame sink wiring for end-to-end low-latency flushing.
* Compressed gRPC messages are rejected with `UNIMPLEMENTED`; compression negotiation is not wired yet.
* The proto generator currently supports scalar proto3 model encoders and service paths, not repeated/nested/enum/descriptor-set bindings.
* HTTP/2 response trailers are represented as gRPC metadata headers for now; dedicated trailer-frame emission is a follow-up.
* No gRPC client, deadline propagation, retry policy, or load-balancing policy exists yet.
