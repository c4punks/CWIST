```

### 1) Transport Layer

* **Native protocols ready**: HTTP/1.1 through HTTP/3 (QUIC via `lsquic`), WebTransport, and WebSocket are all implemented in-tree. Low-level socket controls (ECN, 0-RTT, connection migration) are complete.
* **HTTP/3 browser hardening**: Response header emission now normalizes field names to lowercase and rejects CR/LF-bearing values, covering login/logout cookie and redirect paths in strict browsers such as Firefox.
* **Async I/O optimization (`io_uring`)**: `io_uring_backend.c`, SQE/CQE synchronization, demolition safety, and focused tests are complete.
* **Multiport HTTP/3 fan-out**: The `cwist_multiport_t` facade now creates per-port UDP contexts and copies global HTTP/3 settings unless a port is detached into a sub-app.

### 2) Application Layer

* **High-performance router & middleware**: Deterministic resource management with parameterized routes (`/user/:id`), compression (Gzip via zlib), CORS, and rate limiting (libttak token bucket) are integrated.
* **Observability**: Prometheus `/metrics` and a probe-registry health-check system are operational.
* **Per-port sub-applications**: Lifecycle and exception handling for `cwist_multiport_get_app(&app, port)` are hardened; detached ports are separately tunable sub-applications.
* **gRPC services**: Applications can register unary gRPC handlers with `cwist_app_grpc_unary()` and buffered streaming handlers with `cwist_app_grpc_stream()`, decode one or more gRPC message envelopes, and return `application/grpc` responses with explicit gRPC status metadata.

### 3) Security & Data Layer

* **Security specs**: BoringSSL-based TLS 1.3 and hybrid post-quantum KEM (`X25519MLKEM768`) are implemented ahead of time. CSRF and automatic secure-header injection remain planned (`⏳`).
* **Data-layer integrity**: SQLite3 embedded integration, migration system, and a `_Generic` macro-based type-dispatched ORM/query builder are in the build stream. The lock-free work queue (`cwist_io_queue`) and scheduler-backed background jobs are implemented.

## Current Snapshot

- Core HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSocket, routing, middleware, validation, metrics, health checks, static-file caching, and graceful shutdown are already implemented in-tree.
- **P0 (must-have) is 100 % complete**: the framework’s core architecture and protocol stack are locked.
- We are now in the **P2–P4 tooling and ecosystem phase**. Completed multiport, scheduler, test-client, `io_uring`, unary/buffered streaming gRPC, and Protobuf wire-format work remain covered by focused regression tests.

## Current Focus (P2 – P4 Tooling and Ecosystem)

The completed P1-P3 hardening work is now under regression coverage. Current priorities are developer workflow and ecosystem integrations.

### Developer Workflow

* Add hot reload and project scaffolding.
* Expand benchmark automation and fuzz targets.
* Keep test-client, scheduler, multiport, and `io_uring` coverage in the default test harness.

### Ecosystem

* Extend buffered gRPC streaming to true incremental HTTP/2 DATA-frame streaming and dedicated trailer-frame emission.
* Add generated-code bindings from `.proto` descriptors once the runtime ABI settles.
* Add gRPC reflection, health checking, deadlines, cancellation propagation, metadata normalization, and trailer-frame emission.
* Add GraphQL and OpenAPI generation.
* Evaluate persistent job backends separately from the in-process queue/scheduler.

### gRPC / Protobuf Status

Completed:

* `cwist_app_grpc_unary(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers `POST /Service/Method` routes for HTTP/2 gRPC unary calls.
* `cwist_app_grpc_stream(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers buffered streaming handlers that can consume multiple request messages and append multiple response messages in order.
* `cwist_grpc_decode_message()` and `cwist_grpc_encode_message()` implement the gRPC 5-byte message envelope (`compressed` flag + big-endian payload length).
* `cwist_grpc_decode_next_message()` iterates concatenated gRPC message envelopes for client-streaming and bidi-style buffered request bodies.
* `cwist_grpc_stream_send()` and `cwist_grpc_stream_close()` build ordered multi-message gRPC responses with final status metadata.
* `cwist_grpc_set_response()` and `cwist_grpc_set_error()` produce `application/grpc` responses and explicit `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` metadata.
* `cwist_pb_writer` supports varint keys, uint64/int64/bool fields, bytes fields, string fields, and dynamic buffer growth.
* `cwist_pb_reader` iterates Protobuf fields and exposes wire type, field number, varint value, and length-delimited payload slices.
* `cwist_pb_zigzag_encode()` / `cwist_pb_zigzag_decode()` cover signed integer mappings used by `sint32` / `sint64` style fields.
* `test_grpc` verifies Protobuf request construction, gRPC frame handling, unary dispatch, buffered streaming dispatch, multi-message response parsing, invalid content type handling, and malformed frame rejection.

Known limits:

* Streaming support is buffered at the application response-body level; true incremental DATA-frame flushing during handler execution remains planned.
* Compressed gRPC messages are rejected with `UNIMPLEMENTED`; compression negotiation is not wired yet.
* Protobuf support is a runtime wire helper, not a `.proto` compiler or generated binding layer.
* HTTP/2 response trailers are represented as gRPC metadata headers for now; dedicated trailer-frame emission is a follow-up.
* No gRPC client, reflection service, health service, deadline propagation, retry policy, or load-balancing policy exists yet.
