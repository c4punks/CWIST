```

### 1) Transport Layer

* **Native protocols ready**: HTTP/1.1 through HTTP/3 (QUIC via `lsquic`), WebTransport server support, WebSocket, SSE, and a bounded GraphQL query layer are implemented in-tree. Low-level socket controls (ECN, 0-RTT, connection migration) are complete.
* **HTTP/3 browser hardening**: Response header emission now normalizes field names to lowercase and rejects CR/LF-bearing values, covering login/logout cookie and redirect paths in strict browsers such as Firefox.
* **Async I/O optimization (`io_uring`)**: `io_uring_backend.c`, SQE/CQE synchronization, demolition safety, and focused tests are complete.
* **Multiport HTTP/3 fan-out**: The `cwist_multiport_t` facade now creates per-port UDP contexts and copies global HTTP/3 settings unless a port is detached into a sub-app.

### 2) Application Layer

* **High-performance router & middleware**: Deterministic resource management with parameterized routes (`/user/:id`), compression (Gzip via zlib), CORS, and rate limiting (libttak token bucket) are integrated.
* **Observability**: Prometheus `/metrics` and a probe-registry health-check system are operational.
* **Per-port sub-applications**: Lifecycle and exception handling for `cwist_multiport_get_app(&app, port)` are hardened; detached ports are separately tunable sub-applications.
* **gRPC services**: Applications can register unary and streaming handlers, incrementally decode arbitrarily split gRPC frames, attach transport output sinks, expose standard health/reflection services, and generate C models/method paths with `cwist proto`.
* **Packaging**: `libcwist.a` is a CWIST-only static archive; bundled dependency archives and public headers install side-by-side with `PREFIX`/`DESTDIR` staging support. `cwist.pc` pkg-config metadata, a versioned dist tarball (`dist/cwist-3.2.tar.gz`), and Homebrew (`packaging/homebrew/cwist.rb`) / vcpkg (`packaging/vcpkg/`) packaging drafts are available.
* **Deferred async handlers**: `cwist_async_defer()` hands a request/response pair to any thread (scheduler job, NATS callback, custom worker) for later completion via `cwist_async_respond()` / `respond_with()` / `abort()`, with optional 504 timeout and per-mode completion routing (reactor-posted in C1M, inline in thread-pool mode).

### 3) Security & Data Layer

* **Security specs**: BoringSSL-based TLS 1.3 and hybrid post-quantum KEM (`X25519MLKEM768`) are implemented ahead of time. CSRF uses a 256-bit double-submit token with constant-time validation; WAF-lite uses bounded linear scans and HTML output escaping.
* **Data-layer integrity**: SQLite3 embedded integration, migration system, and a `_Generic` macro-based type-dispatched ORM/query builder are in the build stream. The lock-free work queue (`cwist_io_queue`) protects node reclamation with ttak EBR critical sections and a two-stage retire deferral across global-epoch boundaries, and scheduler-backed background jobs are implemented.
* **Protobuf wire helpers**: A lightweight Protobuf runtime supports varint keys, unsigned/signed/bool fields, length-delimited bytes/strings, reader iteration, and ZigZag helpers for hand-written services.

## Current Snapshot

<!-- CI-BENCHMARKS:START -->
Automated OS & Web Server benchmark histories are published in `docs/benchmark-trends.svg` and `docs/webserver-benchmark-trends.svg`. Latest platform: **Linux / Darwin**.
<!-- CI-BENCHMARKS:END -->

- Core HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, WebSocket, routing, middleware, validation, metrics, health checks, static-file caching, and graceful shutdown are fully implemented in-tree.
- **Developer Ecosystem & Tutorials**: 30 comprehensive hands-on tutorial modules with C source (`main.c`), `CMakeLists.txt`, and English documentation guides (`README.md`) are available under `tutorials/`.
- **CI Automated Web Server Benchmark**: Inline CI job dynamically generates and measures CWIST, Axum, and Spring Boot web servers using `wrk`, rendering real-time RPS, Latency, Peak RSS, and Context Switch metrics. A `the-benchmarker/web-frameworks` contract app lives in `benchmarks/web-frameworks/`, pinned to the `v3.2` tag with the uriparser lib path wired in.
- **P0 (must-have) is 100% complete**: the framework’s core architecture and protocol stack are locked.
- We are now in the **P2–P4 tooling and ecosystem phase**. Completed multiport, scheduler, test-client, `io_uring`, deferred async handlers, end-to-end streaming gRPC (DATA-frame wiring, trailers, deadlines, gzip), and Protobuf wire-format work remain covered by focused regression tests.

## Current Focus (P2 – P4 Tooling and Ecosystem)

The completed P1-P3 hardening work is now under regression coverage. Current priorities are developer workflow and ecosystem integrations.

### Developer Workflow

* Expand benchmark automation (the-benchmarker contract app) and fuzz targets.
* Add a POLLOUT-resumable writer for deferred async completions so slow clients cannot occupy a reactor thread for the SO_SNDTIMEO budget.
* Keep test-client, scheduler, multiport, `io_uring`, and deferred-async coverage in the default test harness.

### Ecosystem

* Extend `cwist proto` beyond scalar proto3 models to repeated, nested, enum, and descriptor-set bindings.
* Add gRPC deadlines, cancellation propagation, metadata normalization, retry policy, and load balancing.
* Extend the GraphQL subset with schema validation, mutations, nested selections, and subscriptions.
* Add a native C WebTransport client after adopting a QUIC dependency with client-session support.
* Evaluate persistent job backends separately from the in-process queue/scheduler.

### gRPC / Protobuf Status

Completed:

* `cwist_app_grpc_unary(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers `POST /Service/Method` routes for HTTP/2 gRPC unary calls.
* `cwist_app_grpc_stream(app, service, method, handler, user_ctx)` registers buffered streaming handlers that can consume multiple request messages and append multiple response messages in order.
* `cwist_grpc_decode_message()` and `cwist_grpc_encode_message()` implement the gRPC 5-byte message envelope (`compressed` flag + big-endian payload length).
* `cwist_grpc_decode_next_message()` iterates concatenated gRPC message envelopes for client-streaming and bidi-style buffered request bodies.
* `cwist_grpc_stream_send()` and `cwist_grpc_stream_close()` build ordered multi-message gRPC responses with final status metadata.
* `cwist_grpc_decoder_feed()` recovers gRPC envelopes split across arbitrary DATA payload boundaries; `cwist_grpc_stream_set_writer()` permits immediate transport-frame output.
* `cwist_app_grpc_health()` and `cwist_app_grpc_health_set_status()` register and control `grpc.health.v1.Health`; `cwist_app_grpc_reflection()` registers the v1alpha reflection stream.
* `cwist proto input.proto` generates scalar proto3 C models, encoder helpers, and gRPC method-path constants.
* `cwist_grpc_set_response()` and `cwist_grpc_set_error()` produce `application/grpc` responses and explicit `grpc-status` / `grpc-message` metadata.
* `cwist_pb_writer` supports varint keys, uint64/int64/bool fields, bytes fields, string fields, and dynamic buffer growth.
* `cwist_pb_reader` iterates Protobuf fields and exposes wire type, field number, varint value, and length-delimited payload slices.
* `cwist_pb_zigzag_encode()` / `cwist_pb_zigzag_decode()` cover signed integer mappings used by `sint32` / `sint64` style fields.
* `test_grpc` verifies Protobuf request construction, gRPC frame handling, unary dispatch, buffered streaming dispatch, multi-message response parsing, invalid content type handling, and malformed frame rejection.

Known limits:

* The incremental decoder and output sink are available now; the current HTTP/2 dispatcher still buffers inbound bodies and needs direct DATA-frame sink wiring for end-to-end low-latency flushing.
* Compressed gRPC messages are rejected with `UNIMPLEMENTED`; compression negotiation is not wired yet.
* The proto generator currently supports scalar proto3 model encoders and service paths, not repeated/nested/enum/descriptor-set bindings.
* HTTP/2 response trailers are represented as gRPC metadata headers for now; dedicated trailer-frame emission is a follow-up.
* No gRPC client, deadline propagation, retry policy, or load-balancing policy exists yet.
