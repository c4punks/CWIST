# Full GC: Automatic Resource Reclamation in CWIST

Status: **implemented, opt-in** (`src/core/mem/gc.c`, `include/cwist/core/mem/gc.h`).
`cwist_full_gc(true)` is a real, callable toggle today, not a future one —
see Tutorial 30 (`tutorials/30-graceful-shutdown/`) for a minimal example.
This document remains the design contract for what the mode does and does
not cover; the explicit destroy-family model stays fully supported (and is
the default) whether or not full-GC mode is ever enabled.

## Motivation

CWIST today relies on disciplined explicit cleanup: `cwist_app_destroy()`,
connection/session teardown at the transport layer, and `cwist_free()` paired
with request arenas. Two gaps remain:

1. **Thread/process exit does not close connections.** If a worker thread (or
   the whole process) ends without the explicit destroy path running, its
   connections linger until the peer or the OS gives up on them.
2. **`cwist_alloc` still requires manual `cwist_free`.** Miss one and the
   object leaks for the life of its owner.

Full-GC mode (`cwist_full_gc(true)`) closes both gaps. When disabled (the
default), the current explicit model runs unchanged at zero cost.

## Design

### 1. `cwist_full_gc(bool)` — the global toggle

```c
cwist_full_gc(true);   /* enable automatic reclamation */
```

One process-wide switch. **This cuts across `cwist_multiport_get_app()`'s
per-port sub-applications.** Multiport advertises detached ports as
"independently tunable sub-applications," but that independence is
app-level config only (routes, middleware, TLS, size limits) -- it was
never true of process-wide subsystems, and `cwist_full_gc()` is one.
Several `cwist_app` instances can share a process (that's the whole point
of multiport), but they cannot have different full-GC settings: enabling
it from any one of them enables it for all of them, with no per-app
opt-out, because the toggle, the pending-sweep bookkeeping, and the
epoch-retire pipeline it drives are all singletons scoped to the process,
not to a `cwist_app *`. (The cJSON allocator hook installed at process
start via a constructor function is the same shape, for the same reason:
there's one cJSON allocator per process, not per app.) A deployment that
genuinely needs different memory-management behavior for different
sub-apps needs separate processes -- separate `cwist_app` instances in one
process cannot get it.

When enabled:

- Connections are closed automatically on **worker-thread exit** and on
  **process exit**, even when no explicit destroy-family call was made.
- `cwist_alloc` objects are registered with the reclamation engine and freed
  by epoch rotation instead of manual `cwist_free` calls.

When disabled, none of the tracking machinery is active; the explicit model
keeps its current performance profile.

### 2. Reclamation engine: libttak epoch GC

The engine is libttak's epoch GC (`ttak_epoch_gc`, see
`lib/libttak/include/ttak/mem/epoch_gc.h`), already wrapped by CWIST in
`src/core/mem/gc.c` (`cwist_gc`, `cwist_reg_ptr`, `cwist_gc_rotate`).

- Each worker thread registers its live connections and `cwist_alloc` blocks
  against the current epoch.
- Reclamation is **epoch-deferred**: a swept object is not reclaimed until
  the epoch rotates past every thread that could still reference it. A
  connection closed at thread exit can therefore never use-after-free a
  thread that is mid-request on it.
- Rotation can be automatic (background rotate thread with adaptive cadence
  driven by allocation hints) or manual (`cwist_gc_rotate` from the event
  loop), matching the existing wrapper semantics.

### 3. Thread/process exit sweeps

- **Thread exit**: a per-thread connection registry lives in thread-local
  storage; a pthread TLS destructor sweeps and closes whatever the thread
  still owns when it exits.
- **Process exit**: an `atexit` sweep performs the same close-out for the
  whole process, so stray connections are shut (TLS shutdown, socket close,
  session teardown) rather than abandoned.

### 4. Pseudo-RAII for handle-like locals

For stack-scoped handles, CWIST provides pseudo-RAII guards:

- GCC/Clang `__attribute__((cleanup))` scoped guards that run the matching
  teardown when the variable leaves scope — C's practical equivalent of
  RAII.
- Raw borrowing of LibTTAK RAII primitives where the cleanup-attribute trick
  is unavailable.

### 5. Transparent `malloc` interception

Users will habitually write `malloc`, not `cwist_alloc` — depending on
finger discipline is how leak-free claims fail. Full-GC mode therefore makes
the two spellings equivalent in handler context:

- Handler-thread `malloc` calls — including allocations made by bundled
  dependencies such as cJSON — are redirected onto the worker-thread
  arena/epoch GC, either via linker wrapping (`-Wl,--wrap=malloc`) or via
  header-level redefinition in framework-included headers.

Acceptance bar: **write `malloc` by habit and it still evaporates at request
end**, with no leaks across the request boundary.

### 6. `cwist_alloc` internals

`src/core/mem/alloc.c` gains a registration hook: under full-GC mode every
`cwist_alloc` block is recorded with the epoch GC (size-aware via
`cwist_reg_ptr_sized`) so epoch rotation reclaims it; explicit `cwist_free`
remains correct and simply unregisters the block early.

## Semantics summary

| Event | Without full_gc (default) | With `cwist_full_gc(true)` |
|---|---|---|
| Worker thread exits | Connections must be closed explicitly | TLS sweep closes owned connections |
| Process exits | `cwist_app_destroy()` required | `atexit` sweep closes remaining connections |
| `cwist_alloc` object | Manual `cwist_free` | Epoch rotation reclaims; explicit free still fine |
| Handler calls `malloc` | Heap leak if forgotten | Redirected to worker arena; freed at request end |
| Teardown safety | Caller discipline | Epoch-deferred; no reclaim while referenced |

## Non-goals and notes

- Full-GC mode is **opt-in**; the default build keeps the explicit model with
  zero tracking overhead.
- This is not a tracing garbage collector: reclamation is epoch-based and
  scoped to framework-managed resources (connections, `cwist_alloc` blocks,
  handler-context `malloc`).
- Kernel-level resources (file descriptors, TLS sessions) are closed
  deterministically by the exit sweeps; the epoch deferral governs only the
  memory reclamation behind them.

## Known performance caveat

Enabling `cwist_full_gc(true)` currently adds roughly **~86% per-call
overhead** to every `cwist_alloc()` / `cwist_free()` pair — approximately
10 ns per operation on a typical workstation — due to
`cwist_gc_scope_track()` / `cwist_gc_scope_untrack()` maintaining a
per-thread pending-sweep list on every allocation and release
(`src/core/mem/gc.c`).

The overhead breakdown and concurrent-load behaviour are tracked in
[issue #65](https://github.com/c4punks/CWIST/issues/65).  A benchmark
harness for measuring both single-threaded and multi-threaded impact is
in `tests/bench_malloc_intercept.c`.

**Practical guidance**: if you opt into full-GC mode on a high-throughput
service, profile your allocation hot path first.  The overhead is only
active when `cwist_full_gc(true)` has been called; all default builds
(full-GC off) are unaffected.
