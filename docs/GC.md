# Full GC: Automatic Resource Reclamation in CWIST

Status: **implemented, opt-in, with one gap** (`src/core/mem/gc.c`,
`include/cwist/core/mem/gc.h`). `cwist_full_gc(true)` is a real, callable
toggle today, not a future one — see Tutorial 30
(`tutorials/30-graceful-shutdown/`) for a minimal example. The toggle,
connection reclamation, `cwist_alloc` registration, pseudo-RAII, and the
exit sweeps (sections 1-4 and 6 below) are all implemented and tested.
**Section 5 (transparent `malloc` interception) is only partially done**:
cJSON's own internal allocations are redirected to `cwist_alloc` via
`cJSON_InitHooks` (`src/core/mem/alloc.c`), but a handler's own bare
`malloc()` calls are not intercepted anywhere in the tree today — no
`-Wl,--wrap=malloc`, no header-level redefinition. The "write `malloc` by
habit and it still evaporates" acceptance bar in section 5 does not hold
yet for a handler's own code, only for the cJSON dependency. This document
remains the design contract for what the mode does and does not cover; the
explicit destroy-family model stays fully supported (and is the default)
whether or not full-GC mode is ever enabled.

## Motivation

CWIST today relies on disciplined explicit cleanup: `cwist_app_destroy()`,
connection/session teardown at the transport layer, and `cwist_free()` paired
with request arenas. Two gaps remain:

1. **Thread/process exit does not close connections.** If a worker thread (or
   the whole process) ends without the explicit destroy path running, its
   connections linger until the peer or the OS gives up on them.
2. **`cwist_alloc` still requires manual `cwist_free`.** Miss one and the
   object leaks for the life of its owner.

Full-GC mode (`cwist_full_gc(true)`) closes both gaps. When disabled (the
default), the current explicit model runs unchanged at zero cost.

## Design

### 1. `cwist_full_gc(bool)` — the global toggle

```c
cwist_full_gc(true);   /* enable automatic reclamation */
```

One process-wide switch. **This cuts across `cwist_multiport_get_app()`'s
per-port sub-applications.** Multiport advertises detached ports as
"independently tunable sub-applications," but that independence is
app-level config only (routes, middleware, TLS, size limits) -- it was
never true of process-wide subsystems, and `cwist_full_gc()` is one.
Several `cwist_app` instances can share a process (that's the whole point
of multiport), but they cannot have different full-GC settings: enabling
it from any one of them enables it for all of them, with no per-app
opt-out, because the toggle, the pending-sweep bookkeeping, and the
epoch-retire pipeline it drives are all singletons scoped to the process,
not to a `cwist_app *`. (The cJSON allocator hook installed at process
start via a constructor function is the same shape, for the same reason:
there's one cJSON allocator per process, not per app.) A deployment that
genuinely needs different memory-management behavior for different
sub-apps needs separate processes -- separate `cwist_app` instances in one
process cannot get it.

When enabled:

- Connections are closed automatically on **worker-thread exit** and on
  **process exit**, even when no explicit destroy-family call was made.
- `cwist_alloc` objects are registered with the reclamation engine and freed
  by epoch rotation instead of manual `cwist_free` calls.

When disabled, none of the tracking machinery is active; the explicit model
keeps its current performance profile.

### 2. Reclamation engine: libttak epoch GC

The engine is libttak's epoch GC (`ttak_epoch_gc`, see
`lib/libttak/include/ttak/mem/epoch_gc.h`), already wrapped by CWIST in
`src/core/mem/gc.c` (`cwist_gc`, `cwist_reg_ptr`, `cwist_gc_rotate`).

- Each worker thread registers its live connections and `cwist_alloc` blocks
  against the current epoch.
- Reclamation is **epoch-deferred**: a swept object is not reclaimed until
  the epoch rotates past every thread that could still reference it. A
  connection closed at thread exit can therefore never use-after-free a
  thread that is mid-request on it.
- Rotation can be automatic (background rotate thread with adaptive cadence
  driven by allocation hints) or manual (`cwist_gc_rotate` from the event
  loop), matching the existing wrapper semantics.

### 3. Thread/process exit sweeps

- **Thread exit**: a per-thread connection registry lives in thread-local
  storage; a pthread TLS destructor sweeps and closes whatever the thread
  still owns when it exits.
- **Process exit**: an `atexit` sweep performs the same close-out for the
  whole process, so stray connections are shut (TLS shutdown, socket close,
  session teardown) rather than abandoned.

### 4. Pseudo-RAII for handle-like locals

For stack-scoped handles, CWIST provides pseudo-RAII guards:

- GCC/Clang `__attribute__((cleanup))` scoped guards that run the matching
  teardown when the variable leaves scope — C's practical equivalent of
  RAII.
- Raw borrowing of LibTTAK RAII primitives where the cleanup-attribute trick
  is unavailable.

### 5. Transparent `malloc` interception — partially done

Users will habitually write `malloc`, not `cwist_alloc` — depending on
finger discipline is how leak-free claims fail. The goal is to make the two
spellings equivalent in handler context. Status:

- **Done**: allocations made by bundled dependencies — currently cJSON — are
  redirected onto `cwist_alloc` via `cJSON_InitHooks` (`src/core/mem/alloc.c`),
  so cJSON's own internal `malloc`/`free` calls already evaporate under
  full-GC mode without any change to cJSON itself.
- **Not done**: a handler's own bare `malloc()` calls are not redirected
  anywhere in the tree today. Neither linker wrapping (`-Wl,--wrap=malloc`)
  nor a header-level `#define malloc` exists yet. Writing `malloc()` by hand
  inside a handler still leaks under full-GC mode exactly as it would
  without it — only `cwist_alloc()` calls (and cJSON's) are covered.

Acceptance bar (not yet met for handler code): **write `malloc` by habit and
it still evaporates at request end**, with no leaks across the request
boundary. This remains open work, not a documentation gap - see the v3.5
roadmap entry.

### 6. `cwist_alloc` internals

`src/core/mem/alloc.c` gains a registration hook: under full-GC mode every
`cwist_alloc` block is recorded with the epoch GC (size-aware via
`cwist_reg_ptr_sized`) so epoch rotation reclaims it; explicit `cwist_free`
remains correct and simply unregisters the block early.

## Semantics summary

| Event | Without full_gc (default) | With `cwist_full_gc(true)` |
|---|---|---|
| Worker thread exits | Connections must be closed explicitly | TLS sweep closes owned connections |
| Process exits | `cwist_app_destroy()` required | `atexit` sweep closes remaining connections |
| `cwist_alloc` object | Manual `cwist_free` | Epoch rotation reclaims; explicit free still fine |
| cJSON's internal `malloc` | N/A (cJSON manages its own memory) | Redirected to `cwist_alloc` via `cJSON_InitHooks`; freed by epoch rotation |
| Handler calls bare `malloc()` | Heap leak if forgotten | **Still a heap leak if forgotten** - not yet redirected (see section 5) |
| Teardown safety | Caller discipline | Epoch-deferred; no reclaim while referenced |

## Non-goals and notes

- Full-GC mode is **opt-in**; the default build keeps the explicit model with
  zero tracking overhead.
- This is not a tracing garbage collector: reclamation is epoch-based and
  scoped to framework-managed resources (connections, `cwist_alloc` blocks,
  handler-context `malloc`).
- Kernel-level resources (file descriptors, TLS sessions) are closed
  deterministically by the exit sweeps; the epoch deferral governs only the
  memory reclamation behind them.

## Known performance caveat

With `cwist_full_gc(true)`, every `cwist_alloc()` inserts the block into
the calling thread's pending set and every `cwist_free()` removes it (or
looks it up and misses, for blocks that were never tracked, such as
`cwist_strdup()` results). The set is an open-addressing hash table, so
both operations are O(1) on average no matter how many blocks the thread
holds, and the thread's set is found through one thread-local load. Each
thread has its own set; there is no shared lock.

`tests/bench_full_gc_tracking.c` (`make bench_full_gc_tracking`) measures
this with N tracked blocks kept alive on the thread. GitHub Actions
`ubuntu-latest` (AMD EPYC 7763, 4 vCPUs), 200000 pairs per measurement,
median of 3 runs, ns per `cwist_alloc()` + `cwist_free()` pair:

| live tracked blocks | full-GC off | full-GC on |
|---|---:|---:|
| 0 | 31.2 | 38.6 |
| 64 | 31.3 | 40.7 |
| 1024 | 19.2 | 32.2 |
| 16384 | 19.2 | 34.1 |

A `cwist_strdup()` + `cwist_free()` pair (the free's lookup misses) costs
22.4-23.5 ns with full-GC on against 16.6-17.2 ns with it off, again flat
across the same live-set sizes. With 1024 live blocks per thread, per-thread
cost with 1/2/4/8 threads churning at once is 34.0/33.2/65.5/104.1 ns with
full-GC on and 25.6/24.9/49.6/79.8 ns with it off; the growth past two
threads appears with full-GC off too (the allocator, and 8 threads on 4
vCPUs), not in the pending sets.

Before issue #65 the set was a list scanned on every removal, so each free
cost time proportional to the blocks the thread held: on the same runner,
288.6 ns per pair at 1024 live blocks and 3853.9 ns at 16384.

**Practical guidance**:

- Use full-GC mode for **rapid prototyping** and convenience-first code where
  manual `cwist_free()` bookkeeping would slow you down. It is the safe
  default for experiments, internal tools, and workloads where raw throughput
  is not the primary concern.
- Keep the **default explicit mode** for **high-throughput production
  services** where every nanosecond of allocation overhead matters. The
  explicit `cwist_alloc()` / `cwist_free()` model has zero tracking cost and
  remains fully supported.
- If you opt into full-GC mode on a high-throughput service, profile your
  allocation hot path first. The overhead is only active when
  `cwist_full_gc(true)` has been called; all default builds (full-GC off) are
  unaffected.
