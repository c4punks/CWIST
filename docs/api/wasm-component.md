# CWIST on the WASM component model

**Status:** experimental (issue #203, v3.7 Phase 1; v3.8 defers the
production switch to v4.0). The supported browser path remains the
Emscripten bundle (`docs/api/wasm.md`); this document describes the component
pipeline that is slated to replace it once the WASI 0.3 world and unflagged
JSPI are usable end to end.

## Why

v3.6 shipped three WASM flavors: the Emscripten browser bundle (supported),
a WASI preview1 smoke (retired by this work; WASI 0.2 covers its use), and
the WASI 0.2 socket server (`docs/api/wasi.md`). Three toolchains cost more
than they earn, and the Emscripten path carries operational friction: a
heavy emsdk, version-sensitive glue, and the EM_JS formatting incident
(#176). The end state is one pipeline: compile with wasi-sdk, run anywhere,
browsers via a jco-transpiled JS bundle, edge runtimes via wasmtime.

## The boundary

`wit/cwist.wit` defines `world cwist-guest`, the component-model
counterpart of `include/cwist/wasm/wasm_entry.h`:

- `dispatch(request: list<u8>) -> result<list<u8>, dispatch-error>`:
  serialized HTTP/1.1 in and out, exactly what `_cwist_wasm_dispatch`
  handles today. The app-side parser needs no changes.
- `use-session(secret: option<string>)`: host-injected session signing
  secret, same contract as `_cwist_wasm_use_session`.
- Buffer disposal that today requires an explicit `_cwist_wasm_dispose`
  round-trip becomes implicit: the canonical ABI copies the result out of
  guest linear memory, and the guest frees its own buffer after return.
- Streaming lives in the separate `cwist-guest-stream` world (0.3 only):
  `host.send-chunk` delivers chunks with backpressure, and
  `dispatch-stream` mirrors `_cwist_wasm_dispatch_stream`. Landed and
  smoke-tested; see below.

## Toolchain status (measured 2026-09-21)

- WASI 0.3: ratified by the WASI subgroup; `wasi:cli 0.3.0` is official
  with component-model async native.
- wasi-sdk 34 (2026-08-25): ships a `wasm32-wasip3` sysroot. CWIST builds
  and links unchanged via `make wasip2-smoke WASIP2_TARGET=wasm32-wasip3`;
  the recipe drops `-lwasi-emulated-pthread` automatically because the
  wasip3 libc covers those symbols (the p1/p2 sysroots keep the library).
- wasmtime 48: runs the resulting component. Startup, in-memory dispatch,
  and socket listen all work.
- jco 1.34.0: transpiles both 0.2 and 0.3 components to JS. 0.3 exports
  lower to async functions; WASI 0.3 imports are satisfied by
  `@bytecodealliance/preview3-shim` (evaluated below).

## Evaluated: preview3-shim (2026-09-23)

`make component-smoke-p3` runs the full dispatch guest as a 0.3 component:
same guest C source, built for `wasm32-wasip3` with wasi-sdk >= 34,
componentized with `wasm-tools component embed`, transpiled by jco 1.34,
hosted in node by preview3-shim 0.6.1, and driven through the same five
assertions as the 0.2 smoke. PASS. Caveats, all host-side:

- node needs `--experimental-wasm-jspi` (JSPI drives the canonical-ABI
  async lowering). The Makefile passes it; no browser flag decision is
  baked in.
- jco lowers every 0.3 export to an async function, so against a wasip3
  guest `handle()` returns a Promise; `wasm/npm/component.js` detects
  this and `await` works uniformly for both targets.
- preview3-shim keeps the node event loop alive after completion, so the
  smoke exits explicitly.

## Landed: native async for streaming/SSE (2026-09-23)

The 0.3 shape for the SSE path (today an EM_JS chunk callback on
Emscripten) is the `cwist-guest-stream` world in wit/cwist.wit: the async
host import `host.send-chunk` plus the sync export `dispatch-stream`.
`make component-stream-smoke-p3` proves it end to end: an SSE route
(`/events`) dispatches through `cwist_app_dispatch_stream()`, each
serialized chunk crosses to a JS host implementation of `sendChunk`, and
the head-first chunk order is asserted.

The pump needed no continuation rewrite. The chunk sink initiates the
async import and, unless it returns immediately, blocks on a waitable
set: the export task suspends mid-pump and resumes when the host
resolves the call, so the synchronous `write_fn` loop in
`cwist_app_dispatch_stream()` runs unchanged. Backpressure falls out of
the host delaying resolution. What the spike established before this
landed: `async func` parses and validates in WIT; wit-bindgen 0.62 emits
waitable-set/callback bindings that compile for wasm32-wasip3 with
wasi-sdk 34; jco surfaces custom host imports as plain ESM imports, which
is how the smoke (and any bundler consumer) wires `sendChunk`.

Only wasm32-wasip3 builds this world: 0.2 components cannot lower async
imports. Bindings are generated per world (`wit-bindgen --world`), and
`wasm-tools component embed` picks the world explicitly
(`--world cwist-guest[-stream]`).

## Resolved: socket request path under wasip3 (audited 2026-09-22)

The first HTTP request to a wasip3 socket server used to trap with an
out-of-bounds read in `serialize_headers` (`res->version->data`,
http.c:1885) at a wild negative address (~`0xffff9c00`), with the response
object intact right up to the send call. The audit (wasi-sdk 34,
wasmtime 49, `-O1`/`-O2`, buffer sizes from 1 KiB/2 KiB to 8 KiB/16 KiB)
established by elimination:

- Not a CWIST memory bug: the response object is valid at the send call
  site; the faulting access misbehaves only after the p3-switched socket
  path runs.
- Not buffer sizes: identical fault across a 16x range.
- Codegen-sensitive (an entry print made it vanish once), which sent the
  audit down a sibling-call-elimination dead end; that flag alone does
  not fix `-O2`.
- Root cause: **stack exhaustion.** wasm-ld's default 64 KiB stack is too
  small for the socket-serving chain once p3's async lowering is in the
  frame mix. `-z stack-size=131072` passes at `-O1` and `-O2`
  deterministically; the Makefile links every wasip2/wasip3 guest with
  `-Wl,-z,stack-size=$(WASIP2_STACK_BYTES)` (default 1 MiB), which covers
  wasip3 with headroom.

A plain BSD-socket minimal repro (accept/read/write, no CWIST) passes
unchanged on the same toolchain, so small-frame guests are unaffected;
CWIST's ~24 KiB of request/response stack buffers plus the p3 lowering
overhead is what crosses the default limit.

## Stages

1. **WIT + validation (landed).** The world definition, `make wit-check`,
   `make jco-transpile`, and this document.
2. **jco browser spike (landed).** `tests/wasm_component_guest.c` is a dispatch guest exporting
   the cwist-guest world through wit-bindgen's canonical ABI shims
   (`include/cwist/wasm/wasm_component.h` holds the shared helpers);
   `make component-smoke` builds it for wasm32-wasip2, componentizes with
   `wasm-tools component embed`, transpiles with jco, and drives it from
   node through the `createCwistFromComponent` adapter (`wasm/npm/component.js`)
   against the same assertions as the Emscripten wrapper test, including the
   signed-cookie session roundtrip and the dispatch-error variant. WASI
   imports are satisfied by `@bytecodealliance/preview2-shim`. Browser
   packaging is gated by `make component-browser-smoke`: a
   `--no-nodejs-compat` re-transpile plus the adapter must bundle under
   esbuild with `--platform=browser` and no node-only imports, which is
   the property a bundler consumer needs (the bundle itself loads its wasm
   shards via fetch and is not executed in the smoke). The npm package
   exposes the adapter through an exports map (`cwist-wasm/component`).
   Emscripten stays supported regardless.
3. **0.3 cutover (conditional).** Both preconditions held up under
   evaluation and the streaming boundary has landed in
   `cwist-guest-stream`. Remaining before the cutover: track JSPI
   shipping unflagged in node and browsers, and port the SSE examples
   off the EM_JS callback. Only then does the Emscripten build leave CI.

## Browser runtime gate (WASI 0.2)

`make component-browser-smoke` remains a packaging-only check.
`make component-browser-test` runs that build, then executes the generated
bundle and real WASM shards in headless Chromium through Playwright.
Install the test-only dependencies and browser first:

```sh
npm ci --prefix tests/browser --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
(cd tests/browser && npx --no-install playwright install --only-shell chromium)
make component-browser-test NODE="$(command -v node)"
```

On Linux CI, add `--with-deps` to the Playwright install command. The
lockfile pins Playwright and therefore its Chromium revision; neither is
added to the production `cwist-wasm` package. The existing component
prerequisites (wasi-sdk 25, wasm-tools, wit-bindgen, jco) still apply.

The runner serves an in-memory allowlist of generated artifacts on a
loopback-only ephemeral port. It checks GET `/hello`, response headers,
and POST `/echo` with the same non-NUL binary payload as the Node smoke.
The fixture uses C strings, so this is not arbitrary NUL-byte coverage.
It requires a structured result from the browser assertions and actual
WASM shard requests. Page exceptions, failed loads, missing dependencies
and timeouts fail rather than skip. Browser and server are closed on exit.

The target also starts two negative controls: unavailable WASM shards and
an injected browser exception. Each must exit 1 with its own diagnostic;
a crash, timeout, or missing browser is not accepted as the expected failure.
To rerun against already-built artifacts:

```sh
node tests/browser/run.mjs --self-test
```

This gate covers WASI 0.2 in Chromium only. It does not claim Service
Worker coverage, WASI 0.3/JSPI support, or replacement of Emscripten.

## Measured while building stage 2

- The WIT never passed wit-bindgen validation as written: the error
  variants sat at package top level. They moved into the `guest`
  interface; `make wit-check` now actually validates the world.
- `wasm-tools component embed` (1.259) emits the final component in one
  step: it merges the cwist-guest world into wasi-sdk's component-type
  section, so no separate `component new` pass is needed.
- wit-bindgen 0.62 lowers guest exports to plain C functions returning
  bool (ok/err out-params). The returned `list<u8>` must be a libc
  allocation because the generated `cabi_post` hook frees it; `cwist_alloc`
  is libc-backed under `__wasi__`, so the dispatch response hands over
  directly and the explicit dispose entry point disappears as designed.
- With two worlds in wit/, both wit-bindgen and `wasm-tools component
  embed` require an explicit `--world`; bindings land in per-world
  directories under .wit-bindings and each guest links its own
  component-type object.

## Non-goals

- No ABI break for the `cwist-wasm` npm wrapper at any stage.
- No removal of the Emscripten build before stage 3 completes.
