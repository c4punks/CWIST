/**
 * @file async.h
 * @brief Deferred-response (async handler) API for CWIST.
 *
 * A route handler that cannot produce its response immediately calls
 * cwist_async_defer() and returns.  The framework then skips its normal
 * send + destroy steps and hands ownership of the request/response pair to
 * the returned cwist_async handle.  Any thread (scheduler job, NATS callback,
 * custom worker) later completes the exchange with exactly one of
 * cwist_async_respond(), cwist_async_respond_with(), or cwist_async_abort().
 *
 * Completion routing depends on the server mode:
 *  - C1M (event-driven) mode: the completion is posted to the owning reactor
 *    (cwist_reactor_post) and finished on the connection's owner thread, so
 *    reactor threads never block on foreign work.  While a request is
 *    deferred the connection is parked: pipelined bytes stay in the receive
 *    stash and are parsed only after the deferred response is sent, keeping
 *    responses ordered.  Keep-alive connections are re-armed afterwards.
 *  - Classic (thread pool) mode: the completing thread writes the response
 *    itself, then re-arms the connection on the pool (keep-alive) or closes
 *    it.
 *  - HTTP/2 mode: the completing thread enqueues the finished exchange on
 *    the owning connection's async queue and pokes its wake fd; the
 *    connection thread drains the queue and emits HEADERS/DATA itself, so
 *    HPACK state and flow control stay single-threaded.  Other streams on
 *    the connection keep being served while a response is deferred.
 *
 * Write-path note (v1): the client fd is O_NONBLOCK in C1M mode; completion
 * temporarily clears it and bounds the write with SO_SNDTIMEO (~5s), so a
 * slow client can occupy a reactor thread for that budget.  A
 * POLLOUT-resumable writer is future work (v2).
 *
 * Deferred responses bypass Big Dumb Reply learning and are never cached.
